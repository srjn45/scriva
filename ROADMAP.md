# FileDBv2 — Project Roadmap & Status

## What This Is

A ground-up rebuild of [FileDB PHP](https://github.com/srjn45/FileDB-php) (a college-era flat-file JSON database) into a production-quality Go service. The goal is a **lightweight, embeddable, local-first database** that:

- Ships as a single binary with zero runtime dependencies
- Stores data as human-readable NDJSON files on disk
- Exposes a gRPC API (with REST gateway) over TCP and Unix socket
- Has a full CLI client with interactive REPL, one-shot commands, and batch scripting
- Auto-generates language-specific client SDKs from a `.proto` file

---

## Design Decisions (Why We Made These Choices)

| Decision | Choice | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Language | Go | Single static binary, goroutines for concurrency, fast compile, easy cross-compile |
| Storage format | Append-only NDJSON | Human readable, crash-safe (no in-place writes), sequential append = fastest disk op |
| Segments | Multiple files per collection, capped by size (default 4MB) | Bounds RAM usage, enables background compaction without blocking writes |
| Concurrency model | Pessimistic locking (`sync.RWMutex` per collection) | Write lock held for microseconds (just append + index update), so reader starvation never happens in practice |
| API protocol | gRPC primary + REST via grpc-gateway | gRPC gives persistent dual-channel connections (HTTP/2 multiplexed), bidirectional streaming, auto-generated SDKs; REST for curl/browser |
| Local transport | Unix domain socket | Bypasses TCP stack entirely for CLI on same machine |
| Compaction trigger | Dirty ratio (>30%) OR time interval (5min) | Dirty ratio prevents wasted space; timer catches slow-write collections |
| Auth | API key via gRPC metadata (`x-api-key`) | Simple, stateless, good enough for local/trusted-network use |

## Architecture in One Page

```
data/
└── users/                         ← one dir per collection
    ├── seg_000001.ndjson           ← sealed (immutable, old entries)
    ├── seg_000002.ndjson           ← sealed
    ├── seg_000003.ndjson           ← active (current append target)
    ├── index.json                  ← id → {segment, byte_offset} + SHA-256 checksum
    └── meta.json                   ← id counter, created_at

Each line in a segment:
{"id":1,"op":"insert","ts":"2026-03-29T10:00:00Z","data":{"name":"alice"}}
{"id":1,"op":"update","ts":"2026-03-29T11:00:00Z","data":{"name":"alice2"}}
{"id":2,"op":"delete","ts":"2026-03-29T12:00:00Z"}

Write path:  append line → update in-memory index → (rotate if size ≥ limit)
Read path:   index lookup → seek to offset → read one line
Compaction:  resolve latest per id → write clean segments → atomic swap → rebuild index
```

## What Is Done ✅

### Durability, benchmarks & OpenAPI — shipped
- [x] Configurable durability policy (`--sync none|always|interval`, `--sync-interval`)
  - `engine.SyncMode` on `CollectionConfig`; `Segment.Sync()` (fsync); per-write fsync for `always`; background flush loop for `interval`

## What Is NOT Done ❌

### High Priority

#### 1. Language clients
The proto file is ready. Two strategies, used together:

- **Universal (cheap):** generate clients from the checked-in OpenAPI spec
  (`docs/openapi/filedb.swagger.json`) with `openapi-generator` — covers nearly
  every language with zero hand-written code.
- **Ergonomic (curated):** hand-written SDKs for the highest-value languages
  where an idiomatic wrapper is worth the maintenance. Seven are scoped — see
  [`clients/PLAN.md`](clients/PLAN.md) — but the OpenAPI path means the long tail
  (Ruby, PHP, C#, …) no longer blocks "use from any language."

| Client | Package manager | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `clients/python/` | PyPI: `pip install filedbv2` | ✅ Done |
| `clients/js/` | npm: `npm install filedbv2` | ✅ Done |
| `clients/php/` | Packagist: `composer require srjn45/filedbv2` | ✅ Done |
| `clients/java/` | Maven Central: `com.srjn45:filedbv2-client` | ✅ Done |
| `clients/ruby/` | RubyGems: `gem install filedbv2` | ⬜ Not started |
| `clients/rust/` | crates.io: `filedbv2` | ⬜ Not started |
| `clients/csharp/` | NuGet: `FileDBv2.Client` | ⬜ Not started |

Each client needs:
1. Proto stub generation (language-specific `protoc` plugin or `buf` remote plugin)
2. Package scaffolding (manifest + directory structure)
3. `FileDB` class wrapper — all RPCs with ergonomic method names
4. Connection setup (host, port, API key, optional TLS CA cert; Unix socket for Python/Node)
5. Runnable example program in `examples/`
6. `README.md` + update to `docs/getting-started.md`
7. Publish config for the package registry

### Medium Priority

#### ~~2. `golangci-lint` — stricter rules~~ ✅ Done
`.golangci.yml` now explicitly enables `staticcheck`, `govet`, `nilerr`, and `misspell` in addition to `bodyclose`, `errorlint`, `copyloopvar`. Generated pb code is excluded. All existing violations were fixed.

### Low Priority / Future

#### ~~3. Secondary indexes~~ ✅ Done
`internal/engine/secondary_index.go` — in-memory inverted index (field-value → ID set).
- `EnsureIndex(field)` / `DropIndex(field)` / `ListIndexes()` on `Collection`
- `Scan` uses the index for single eq-filters (O(1)), falls back to full scan otherwise
- Index maintained on Insert/Update/Delete and rebuilt after compaction
- Persisted to `sidx_<field>.json` with SHA-256 checksum, reloaded on startup
- gRPC: `EnsureIndex` / `DropIndex` / `ListIndexes` RPCs + REST via grpc-gateway
- CLI: `ensure-index`, `drop-index`, `indexes` commands

#### ~~4. TLS support~~ ✅ Done
Optional TLS on the TCP gRPC listener via `--tls-cert` / `--tls-key` server flags.
- `credentials.NewTLS()` used for the TCP gRPC server when both flags are set
- REST gateway dials gRPC with `InsecureSkipVerify` for the internal loopback hop
- Unix socket server always uses `insecure.NewCredentials()` (local-only transport)
- CLI `--tls-ca <pem>` builds a `x509.CertPool` and dials with `credentials.NewTLS()`; omit for insecure (or Unix socket auto-detect)

#### ~~5. Config file (`filedb.yaml`)~~ ✅ Done
`server/config.go` — `LoadConfigFile(path)` reads a YAML config file via `gopkg.in/yaml.v3`, falling back to defaults for omitted fields. `--config` flag on the `serve` command loads it before applying CLI flag overrides (CLI always wins).

#### ~~6. Metrics / observability~~ ✅ Done
`internal/metrics/metrics.go` — Prometheus instrumentation via `github.com/prometheus/client_golang`.
- `filedb_collection_records_total` / `filedb_collection_segments_total` — per-collection gauges via a custom `DBCollector` (sampled at scrape time)
- `filedb_compaction_runs_total` / `filedb_compaction_duration_seconds` — counter + histogram per collection (via `OnCompaction` hook in `CollectionConfig`)
- `filedb_grpc_request_duration_seconds` — histogram by method + status code (via unary interceptor)
- Served at `--metrics-addr` (default `:9090`) on `/metrics`; set to empty string to disable

## Key Files Reference

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [proto/filedb.proto](proto/filedb.proto) | Single source of truth for all APIs — edit here first |
| [internal/engine/collection.go](internal/engine/collection.go) | Core read/write logic, RWMutex, Watch |
| [internal/engine/compactor.go](internal/engine/compactor.go) | Background compaction goroutine |
| [internal/engine/index.go](internal/engine/index.go) | In-memory index, checksum, rebuild |
| [internal/engine/segment.go](internal/engine/segment.go) | NDJSON file I/O, crash recovery |
| [server/grpc.go](server/grpc.go) | gRPC handlers — proto → engine mapping |
| [cmd/filedb/main.go](cmd/filedb/main.go) | Server binary, startup, graceful shutdown |
| [cmd/filedb-cli/repl.go](cmd/filedb-cli/repl.go) | Interactive REPL |
| [cmd/filedb-cli/commands.go](cmd/filedb-cli/commands.go) | All CLI subcommands |
| [Makefile](Makefile) | All dev tasks |

## How to Pick This Up

```bash
cd FileDBv2

# Build
make build

# Run tests
make test

# Start server
make run          # serves on :5433 (gRPC), :8080 (REST), /tmp/filedb.sock

# Use CLI
make cli          # connects to local socket automatically
```

Next logical steps in order:
1. Language clients — unlocks the "use from any language" goal (Python, PHP, JS)
2. Secondary indexes — makes filtered queries O(log n) instead of O(n)
3. TLS support — hardens network transport
4. Metrics endpoint — adds Prometheus observability
