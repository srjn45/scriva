# ScrivaDB — Project Roadmap & Status

## What This Is

A ground-up rebuild of [FileDB PHP](https://github.com/srjn45/FileDB-php) (a college-era flat-file JSON database) into a production-quality Go service. The goal is a **lightweight, embeddable, local-first database** that:

- Ships as a single binary with zero runtime dependencies
- Stores data as human-readable NDJSON files on disk
- Exposes a gRPC API (with REST gateway) over TCP and Unix socket
- Has a full CLI client with interactive REPL, one-shot commands, and batch scripting
- Auto-generates language-specific client SDKs from a `.proto` file

---

## Design Decisions (Why We Made These Choices)

| Decision | Choice | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Language | Go | Single static binary, goroutines for concurrency, fast compile, easy cross-compile |
| Storage format | Append-only NDJSON | Human readable, crash-safe (no in-place writes), sequential append = fastest disk op |
| Segments | Multiple files per collection, capped by size (default 4MB) | Bounds RAM usage, enables background compaction without blocking writes |
| Concurrency model | Pessimistic locking (`sync.RWMutex` per collection) | Write lock held for microseconds (just append + index update), so reader starvation never happens in practice |
| API protocol | gRPC primary + REST via grpc-gateway | gRPC gives persistent dual-channel connections (HTTP/2 multiplexed), bidirectional streaming, auto-generated SDKs; REST for curl/browser |
| Local transport | Unix domain socket | Bypasses TCP stack entirely for CLI on same machine |
| Compaction trigger | Dirty ratio (>30%) OR time interval (5min) | Dirty ratio prevents wasted space; timer catches slow-write collections |
| Auth | API key via gRPC metadata (`x-api-key`) | Simple, stateless, good enough for local/trusted-network use |

## Architecture in One Page

```
data/
└── users/                         ← one dir per collection
    ├── seg_000001.ndjson           ← sealed (immutable, old entries)
    ├── seg_000002.ndjson           ← sealed
    ├── seg_000003.ndjson           ← active (current append target)
    ├── index.json                  ← id → {segment, byte_offset} + SHA-256 checksum
    └── meta.json                   ← id counter, created_at

Each line in a segment:
{"id":1,"op":"insert","ts":"2026-03-29T10:00:00Z","data":{"name":"alice"}}
{"id":1,"op":"update","ts":"2026-03-29T11:00:00Z","data":{"name":"alice2"}}
{"id":2,"op":"delete","ts":"2026-03-29T12:00:00Z"}

Write path:  append line → update in-memory index → (rotate if size ≥ limit)
Read path:   index lookup → seek to offset → read one line
Compaction:  resolve latest per id → write clean segments → atomic swap → rebuild index
```

## Release status

**v0.3.0 — released** (`v*` tag → goreleaser → GitHub Releases + GHCR). The core
is feature-complete and the entire post-v0.1.0 plan
([**docs/roadmap-v0.2.md**](docs/roadmap-v0.2.md), milestones v0.2.0–v0.5.0) has
shipped, including per-record TTL over the wire and full API parity across all
seven client SDKs. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the per-release
breakdown. The next arc is planned in
[**docs/roadmap-v0.6.md**](docs/roadmap-v0.6.md).

The **v0.8.0 Replication & HA** arc is complete: **R1 — leader→follower log
shipping** (async replication with a monotonic global LSN, snapshot bootstrap +
stream catch-up, `--replicate-from` follower mode, and a `ReplicationStatus`
RPC), **R2 — read replicas** (followers serve reads and reject writes with a
typed `FailedPrecondition`, exposing their applied-LSN staleness bound), and
**R3 — manual failover** (an admin `Promote` RPC/CLI that flips a caught-up
follower to leader, guarded against promoting a lagging replica — see
[docs/operations.md](docs/operations.md)). Automatic leader election stays out
of scope.

The **v1.0.0 ScrivaDB rebrand** is complete: the project formerly known as
FileDB v2 is now **ScrivaDB** (slug `scriva`). The Go module moved to
`github.com/srjn45/scriva`, binaries are `scriva`/`scriva-cli`, the proto wire
package is `scriva.v1` (service `Scriva`), env vars are `SCRIVA_*`, and metrics
carry the `scriva_*` prefix. Binaries ship via Homebrew/Scoop/apt/rpm/AUR and
multi-arch signed Docker images on GHCR + Docker Hub, and all seven client SDKs
publish under their new registry names. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the
full breaking-change and migration notes.

## What Is NOT Done ❌

### High Priority

#### 1. Language clients
The proto file is ready. Two strategies, used together:

- **Universal (cheap):** generate clients from the checked-in OpenAPI spec
  (`docs/openapi/scriva.swagger.json`) with `openapi-generator` — covers nearly
  every language with zero hand-written code.
- **Ergonomic (curated):** hand-written SDKs for the highest-value languages
  where an idiomatic wrapper is worth the maintenance. Seven are scoped — see
  [`clients/PLAN.md`](clients/PLAN.md) — but the OpenAPI path means the long tail
  (Ruby, PHP, C#, …) no longer blocks "use from any language."

| Client | Package manager | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `clients/python/` | PyPI: `pip install scriva` | ✅ Done |
| `clients/js/` | npm: `npm install scriva` | ✅ Done |
| `clients/php/` | Packagist: `composer require srjn45/scriva` | ✅ Done |
| `clients/java/` | Maven Central: `com.srjn45:scriva-client` | ✅ Done |
| `clients/ruby/` | RubyGems: `gem install scriva` | ✅ Done |
| `clients/rust/` | crates.io: `scriva` | ✅ Done |
| `clients/csharp/` | NuGet: `Scriva.Client` | ✅ Done |

Each client needs:
1. Proto stub generation (language-specific `protoc` plugin or `buf` remote plugin)
2. Package scaffolding (manifest + directory structure)
3. `Scriva` class wrapper — all RPCs with ergonomic method names
4. Connection setup (host, port, API key, optional TLS CA cert; Unix socket for Python/Node)
5. Runnable example program in `examples/`
6. `README.md` + update to `docs/getting-started.md`
7. Publish config for the package registry

### Medium Priority

#### ~~2. `golangci-lint` — stricter rules~~ ✅ Done
`.golangci.yml` now explicitly enables `staticcheck`, `govet`, `nilerr`, and `misspell` in addition to `bodyclose`, `errorlint`, `copyloopvar`. Generated pb code is excluded. All existing violations were fixed.

### Low Priority / Future

#### ~~3. Secondary indexes~~ ✅ Done
`engine/secondary_index.go` — in-memory inverted index (field-value → ID set).
- `EnsureIndex(field)` / `DropIndex(field)` / `ListIndexes()` on `Collection`
- `Scan` uses the index for single eq-filters (O(1)), falls back to full scan otherwise
- Index maintained on Insert/Update/Delete and rebuilt after compaction
- Persisted to `sidx_<field>.json` with SHA-256 checksum, reloaded on startup
- gRPC: `EnsureIndex` / `DropIndex` / `ListIndexes` RPCs + REST via grpc-gateway
- CLI: `ensure-index`, `drop-index`, `indexes` commands

#### ~~4. TLS support~~ ✅ Done
Optional TLS on the TCP gRPC listener via `--tls-cert` / `--tls-key` server flags.
- `credentials.NewTLS()` used for the TCP gRPC server when both flags are set
- REST gateway dials gRPC with `InsecureSkipVerify` for the internal loopback hop
- Unix socket server always uses `insecure.NewCredentials()` (local-only transport)
- CLI `--tls-ca <pem>` builds a `x509.CertPool` and dials with `credentials.NewTLS()`; omit for insecure (or Unix socket auto-detect)

#### ~~5. Config file (`scriva.yaml`)~~ ✅ Done
`server/config.go` — `LoadConfigFile(path)` reads a YAML config file via `gopkg.in/yaml.v3`, falling back to defaults for omitted fields. `--config` flag on the `serve` command loads it before applying CLI flag overrides (CLI always wins).

#### ~~6. Metrics / observability~~ ✅ Done
`internal/metrics/metrics.go` — Prometheus instrumentation via `github.com/prometheus/client_golang`.
- `scriva_collection_records_total` / `scriva_collection_segments_total` — per-collection gauges via a custom `DBCollector` (sampled at scrape time)
- `scriva_compaction_runs_total` / `scriva_compaction_duration_seconds` — counter + histogram per collection (via `OnCompaction` hook in `CollectionConfig`)
- `scriva_grpc_request_duration_seconds` — histogram by method + status code (via unary interceptor)
- Served at `--metrics-addr` (default `:9090`) on `/metrics`; set to empty string to disable

## Post-v0.1.0 roadmap (Hardening & Scale)

Derived from the 2026-06-29 codebase review. Full plan with per-item approach,
files, tests, and acceptance criteria in
[**docs/roadmap-v0.2.md**](docs/roadmap-v0.2.md).

| Milestone | Theme | Key items |
|---|---|---|
| **v0.2.0** | Durability & correctness hardening | dir fsync, atomic/off-hot-path `meta.json`, per-record checksums, Watch overflow signal, propagate rotation errors, transaction GC |
| **v0.3.0** | Query at scale | streaming push-down `Find` (honor `limit` before materializing), typed/directional `order_by`, range-capable secondary indexes, context cancellation |
| **v0.4.0** | Feature breadth | TTL / expiring records, backup/snapshot, on-demand compaction |
| **v0.5.0** | Auth & multi-tenancy | multiple scoped, rotatable API keys |

---

## Key Files Reference

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [proto/scriva.proto](proto/scriva.proto) | Single source of truth for all APIs — edit here first |
| [engine/collection.go](engine/collection.go) | Core read/write logic, RWMutex, Watch |
| [engine/compactor.go](engine/compactor.go) | Background compaction goroutine |
| [engine/index.go](engine/index.go) | In-memory index, checksum, rebuild |
| [engine/segment.go](engine/segment.go) | NDJSON file I/O, crash recovery |
| [server/grpc.go](server/grpc.go) | gRPC handlers — proto → engine mapping |

---

## How to Pick This Up

```bash
cd scriva

# Build
make build

# Run tests
make test

# Start server
make run          # serves on :5433 (gRPC), :8080 (REST), /tmp/scriva.sock

# Use CLI
make cli          # connects to local socket automatically
```

Next logical steps are tracked in [docs/roadmap-v0.2.md](docs/roadmap-v0.2.md).
In order:
1. **v0.2.0 durability hardening** — directory fsync, atomic `meta.json`,
   propagate rotation errors (one PR); then transaction GC, Watch overflow
   signal, per-record checksums.
2. **v0.3.0 query at scale** — streaming push-down `Find`, range indexes.
3. **v0.4.0 features** — TTL records, backup/snapshot, on-demand compaction.
4. **v0.5.0 auth** — multiple scoped, rotatable API keys.
